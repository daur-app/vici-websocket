## 📖 Overview

This WebSocket server (built with **Socket.IO**) enables real-time location sharing between users during running sessions. Users can:

- **Connect & Join Rooms** — Authenticate via Clerk and join a tracking room
- **View Other Runners** — See all currently active users on a map in real-time
- **Start Sessions** — Begin a running session to share location with others
- **Track Their Path** — Location updates are stored both locally (client) and in Redis (server)
- **Reconnect Sessions** — Resume a session within a 30-second grace window after disconnect
- **End Sessions** — Stop sharing location when finished running

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Node.js** + **TypeScript** | Server runtime & language |
| **Socket.IO v4** | WebSocket communication |
| **ioredis** | Redis client for data persistence |
| **@clerk/backend** | Clerk authentication |
| **@prisma/client** | Database connection for user lookup / sync |
| **dotenv** | Environment variable management |
| **Docker** | Containerized deployment |

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | ✅ Yes | — | Secret key used to verify Clerk tokens |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ❌ No | — | Legacy Postgres connection URL (no longer required for WebSocket authentication) |
| `REDIS_URL` | ❌ No | `localhost:6379` | Redis connection URL (supports `redis://` and `rediss://` for TLS) |
| `SESSION_RESUME_WINDOW_MS` | ❌ No | `172800000` (48h) | Time (in ms) a disconnected session stays alive before cleanup |
| `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` | ❌ No | `10000` (10s) | How often buffered location points are flushed to Redis (in ms) |

**.env.example:**

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://something:password@host:port/db
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
SESSION_RESUME_WINDOW_MS=30000
```

---

## 🔌 Connection & Authentication

### Endpoint

```
ws://YOUR_SERVER_HOST:3000
```

An HTTP health check is also available at the same URL:

```
GET http://YOUR_SERVER_HOST:3000
→ 200 OK — "Socket server is running"
```

### Authentication

The server requires **Clerk JWT authentication** during the WebSocket handshake. Provide the token in one of two ways:

```typescript
// Option 1: Via auth object (recommended)
const socket = io("ws://YOUR_SERVER_HOST:3000", {
  auth: {
    token: "your-clerk-token"
  }
});

// Option 2: Via headers
const socket = io("ws://YOUR_SERVER_HOST:3000", {
  transportOptions: {
    websocket: {
      extraHeaders: {
        token: "your-clerk-token"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Token Verification and User Sync

The server verifies the token signature using `@clerk/backend`. It directly extracts the legacy DB numeric `userId` from a **custom claim configured in the Clerk dashboard's session token**. This eliminates the need for any slow database lookups during the handshake protocol.

### Connection Errors

If authentication fails (missing, invalid, or expired token), the connection is **rejected**:

```typescript
socket.on("connect_error", (error) => {
  if (error.message === "UNAUTHORIZED") {
    // Token is missing, invalid, or expired
    // Redirect user to login
  }
});
```

> ⚠️ If the token is invalid, or if the Clerk user does not exist in the local database (`USER_NOT_SYNCED`), the socket is immediately **force-disconnected** after connection.

## 📤 Client → Server Events

### 1. `join-room`

Join a room to receive location updates from other active users. After joining, the server immediately responds with a `location:snapshot` event.

**Emit:**

```typescript
// Solo mode (default) — see other solo runners
socket.emit("join-room", "central-park-runners");
// OR
socket.emit("join-room", { roomId: "central-park-runners" });

// Team mode — see ALL team runners (across all teams)
socket.emit("join-room", { roomId: "central-park-runners", teamId: 5 });
```

| Parameter | Type     | Required | Description                          |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `roomId`  | `string` | ✅       | Any unique string identifier for the room |
| `teamId`  | `number` | ❌       | If provided, join in team mode (see all team runners). If omitted, join in solo mode. |

> 💡 **Visibility isolation:** Solo viewers only see solo runners. Team viewers see ALL team runners (from any team). The `teamId` in the payload is used to determine the viewer's mode — once in team mode, you see all team runners regardless of their specific team.

**Server Response:** Emits `location:snapshot` with active users matching your mode (solo or team).

**Backward Compatibility:** Passing a plain string (instead of an object) defaults to solo mode.

**Error Handling:** If `roomId` is empty/falsy, the request is **silently ignored** (no error emitted).

---

### 2. `leave-room`

Leave a previously joined room. The socket is removed from the sub-room and stops receiving location updates and broadcasts from that room. If the socket had an active session in the room, it is cleaned up (same behavior as a disconnect for that room).

**Emit:**

```typescript
// Solo mode — leave the solo sub-room
socket.emit("leave-room", "central-park-runners");
// OR
socket.emit("leave-room", { roomId: "central-park-runners" });

// Team mode — leave the team sub-room
socket.emit("leave-room", { roomId: "central-park-runners", teamId: 5 });
```

| Parameter | Type     | Required | Description                          |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `roomId`  | `string` | ✅       | The room to leave                    |
| `teamId`  | `number` | ❌       | If provided, leave the team sub-room. If omitted, leave the solo sub-room. |

**What happens internally:**
1. The socket leaves the Socket.IO sub-room (`room:{roomId}:solo` or `room:{roomId}:team`).
2. If this socket had an active session in that room, it is **detached** from the session.
3. If no other sockets remain for that user's session, `user:offline` is broadcast and the session enters the reconnect grace period (same as disconnect).
4. The session data is **not immediately destroyed** — the user can still reconnect within `SESSION_RESUME_WINDOW_MS`.

**Server Response:** Emits `room:left` with `{ roomId }` as acknowledgement.

**Backward Compatibility:** Passing a plain string (instead of an object) defaults to solo mode (same as `join-room`).

**Error Handling:** If `roomId` is empty/falsy, the request is **silently ignored** (no error emitted).

---

### 3. `start-session`

Start a running session to begin broadcasting your location to other users in the room.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("start-session", {
  roomId: string,
  sessionId: number,
  sessionMode?: "normal" | "ghost" | "private",  // Optional, defaults to "normal"
  teamId?: number                                 // Optional — if provided, runs in team mode
});
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// Solo run (default) — location is shared with other solo runners
socket.emit("start-session", {
  roomId: "central-park-runners",
  sessionId: 12345
});

// Team run — location is shared with ALL team runners (any team)
socket.emit("start-session", {
  roomId: "central-park-runners",
  sessionId: 12345,
  teamId: 5
});

// Ghost mode + team — invisible but captures territory for team 5
socket.emit("start-session", {
  roomId: "central-park-runners",
  sessionId: 12345,
  sessionMode: "ghost",
  teamId: 5
});
```

| Parameter     | Type     | Required | Description                                   |
|---------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `roomId`      | `string` | ✅       | Must match the room you joined earlier         |
| `sessionId`   | `number` | ✅       | Session ID obtained from your Express backend  |
| `sessionMode` | `string` | ❌       | `"normal"` (default), `"ghost"`, or `"private"`. Ghost and private suppress all room broadcasts. |
| `teamId`      | `number` | ❌       | If provided, the session runs in **team mode** — the user's location is only broadcast to other team runners. If omitted, the session runs in **solo mode**. |

**What happens internally:**
1. If this socket was attached to a different session, it is **detached** from the previous one.
2. If the user already has an active session in this room (e.g., from another device), the socket is **added** to the existing session's socket set.
3. Any pending reconnect timer is **cancelled**.
4. The socket joins a **sub-room** based on the session type: `room:{roomId}:solo` (solo) or `room:{roomId}:team` (team). This ensures solo and team runners are **completely isolated** from each other.
5. If `sessionMode` is `"ghost"` or `"private"`, the user enters **stealth mode** — see [Session Modes](#-session-modes) below.

**Error Handling:** If `roomId` or `sessionId` is missing, the request is **silently ignored**.

---

### 4. `location:update`

Send your current GPS location. **Only works after `start-session`** — if no active session exists for this socket, the update is silently ignored.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("location:update", {
  lat: number,
  lng: number,
  minute?: number   // Active-minute counter (1, 2, 3 …) — only increments while running
});
```

**Example:**

```typescript
// Basic location update (no speed tracking)
socket.emit("location:update", {
  lat: 40.785091,
  lng: -73.968285
});

// Location update with active-minute marker (for per-minute speed analysis)
socket.emit("location:update", {
  lat: 40.785091,
  lng: -73.968285,
  minute: 3   // 3rd active minute of the session
});
```

| Parameter | Type     | Required | Description          |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| `lat`     | `number` | ✅       | Latitude coordinate  |
| `lng`     | `number` | ✅       | Longitude coordinate |
| `minute`  | `number` | ❌       | Active-minute counter sent by the frontend. Only increments while the session is actively running — pauses and disconnections should **not** increment this counter. Used by the backend to compute per-minute average speed. |

**What happens internally:**
1. If the location is **identical** to the last known position (same `lat`/`lng`), it is **silently skipped** (consecutive deduplication).
2. A `ts` (Unix timestamp in ms) is **added by the server** via `Date.now()`.
3. If `minute` is provided, it is **included** in the stored data point.
4. The user's in-memory location is **updated**.
5. The location point is **buffered** in memory (flushed to Redis every 10 seconds via `RPUSH` to `session:{sessionId}:path`).
6. The location (with `userId`, `ts`, and `avatarUrl`) is **broadcast immediately** to all other users in the room via `location:update` (skipped in ghost/private mode).

> 💡 **Buffered writes:** Location points are NOT written to Redis on every update. They are collected in an in-memory buffer and flushed to Redis every 10 seconds (configurable via `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`). The buffer is always flushed before `end-session` and on disconnect. Real-time broadcasts to other users are **not affected** — they happen immediately.

> 💡 **Active-minute tracking:** The `minute` field enables per-minute speed analysis on the backend. The frontend should maintain a counter that starts at `1` when the session begins, increments by `1` every 60 seconds of **active running time**, and **freezes** during pauses. This way, gaps in the minute sequence naturally represent paused/disconnected periods — no extra logic needed.

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

### 5. `end-session`

End your running session. Stops broadcasting your location and notifies other users.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("end-session");
// No payload required
```

**What happens internally:**
1. All sockets belonging to this user's session are **removed** from the room.
2. The user's session is **deleted** from in-memory state.
3. If the room becomes empty, it is **cleaned up** from memory.
4. A `user:offline` event is **broadcast** to remaining room members (skipped in ghost/private mode).

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

### 6. `reconnect-session`

Attempt to resume a previously active session after a disconnection. This must be called within the **reconnect grace period** (`SESSION_RESUME_WINDOW_MS`, default 48 hours).

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("reconnect-session", {
  roomId: string,
  sessionId?: number  // Optional — used for validation
});
```

**Example:**

```typescript
socket.emit("reconnect-session", {
  roomId: "central-park-runners",
  sessionId: 12345
});
```

| Parameter   | Type     | Required | Description                                                |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `roomId`    | `string` | ✅       | The room to reconnect to                                   |
| `sessionId` | `number` | ❌       | If provided, must match the active session's ID for validation |

**Server Response:**

| Scenario | Event Emitted | Payload |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| ✅ Success | `session:resumed` | `{ roomId, sessionId, location, disconnectedAt }` |
| ❌ `roomId` missing | `session:resume-failed` | `{ reason: "room-missing" }` |
| ❌ No active session found | `session:resume-failed` | `{ reason: "not-active" }` |
| ❌ `sessionId` doesn't match | `session:resume-failed` | `{ reason: "session-mismatch" }` |

---

### 7. `location:sync-buffered`

Send buffered location points that were collected while the socket was disconnected. **Must be called after a successful `reconnect-session`** — the socket needs an active session.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("location:sync-buffered", {
  locations: [
    { lat: 40.785091, lng: -73.968285, ts: 1706636270000 },
    { lat: 40.785120, lng: -73.968300, ts: 1706636272000 },
    { lat: 40.785150, lng: -73.968320, ts: 1706636274000 }
  ]
});
```

| Parameter   | Type                                    | Required | Description                                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `locations` | `Array<{ lat, lng, ts }>` | ✅       | Buffered location points with client-side timestamps |

**What happens internally:**
1. Validates the socket has an active session.
2. Validates `locations` is a non-empty array.
3. **Deduplicates** — filters out points with `ts <= lastKnownTimestamp` (already received before disconnect).
4. Uses a single Redis pipeline to `RPUSH` only the **new** points into `session:{sessionId}:path`.
5. Updates `last-location` key with the **last** point.
6. Updates in-memory location state.
7. Emits `location:sync-ack` with `{ count }` — the number of **new** points stored (may be 0 if all were duplicates).
8. Broadcasts the latest position to the room (skipped in ghost/private mode).

> ⚠️ Buffered points use the **frontend's `ts`** (historical timestamps), unlike `location:update` which uses server-side `Date.now()`.

**Server Response:** Emits `location:sync-ack` with `{ count: number }`.

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session or `locations` is empty.

---

### 8. `session:pause`

Pause the current running session. The user will be treated as **offline** — their marker is removed for other users, and any `location:update` events sent while paused are **silently rejected**. The session stays alive (it is NOT ended), and the socket remains connected.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("session:pause");
// No payload required
```

**What happens internally:**
1. The user's session is flagged as `paused = true`.
2. A `user:offline` event is broadcast to other users in the room — markers removed (skipped in ghost/private mode).
3. Any incoming `location:update` events are **silently rejected** while paused.
4. The user is **excluded from `location:snapshot`** results while paused.
5. A `session:paused` acknowledgement is sent back to the caller.

**Server Response:** Emits `session:paused` with `{ sessionId }`.

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

### 9. `session:resume`

Resume a paused session. The user becomes online again — location updates are accepted, and other users are notified.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("session:resume");
// No payload required
```

**What happens internally:**
1. The user's session is unflagged (`paused = false`).
2. If the user has a last known location, a `user:online` event is broadcast to other users in the room (skipped in ghost/private mode).
3. `location:update` events are accepted again.
4. The user reappears in `location:snapshot` results (except in ghost/private mode).
5. A `session:resumed-active` acknowledgement is sent back to the caller.

**Server Response:** Emits `session:resumed-active` with `{ sessionId }`.

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

### 10. `discard-session` (or `discard-sesion`)

Completely discard and delete the current running session's location data from Redis, and end the session. Stops broadcasting your location and removes your data from the server.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("discard-session");
// No payload required
```

**What happens internally:**
1. All location history (`session:{sessionId}:path`) for this session is **deleted** from Redis.
2. The last known location (`session:{sessionId}:user:{userId}:last-location`) is **deleted** from Redis.
3. The session is **ended** identically to `end-session` (removed from memory, `user:offline` broadcast to room — skipped in ghost/private mode).

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

### 11. `user:hype`

Send a "hype" (highfive) to a specific user in the room.

**Emit:**

```typescript
socket.emit("user:hype", { targetUserId: number });
```

**Example:**

```typescript
socket.emit("user:hype", { targetUserId: 5 });
```

| Parameter      | Type     | Required | Description                     |
|----------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------|
| `targetUserId` | `number` | ✅       | The user ID to send the hype to |

**What happens internally:**
1. The server verifies the sender has an active session.
2. The server verifies the target user is active in the room and is not in ghost/private mode.
3. The server broadcasts a `user:hype` event to the room containing the `senderId` and `targetUserId`.
4. Skipped if the sender or target is in ghost/private mode.

**Error Handling:** Silently ignored if the socket is not in an active session.

---

## 📥 Server → Client Events

### 1. `location:snapshot`

Received **immediately after** emitting `join-room`. Contains only **currently connected** users in the room with their last known location. Users who disconnected (even if within the reconnect window), paused users, and users in **ghost/private mode** are **excluded**.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("location:snapshot", (snapshot) => {
  // Render all active users on the map
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
type LocationSnapshot = Array<{
  userId: number;
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
  ts: number;      // Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
  avatarUrl: string;  // User's avatar URL (from Redis cache)
}>;
```

**Example Response:**

```json
[
  { "userId": 1, "lat": 40.785091, "lng": -73.968285, "ts": 1706636270000, "avatarUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar1.jpg" },
  { "userId": 2, "lat": 40.782865, "lng": -73.965355, "ts": 1706636268000, "avatarUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar3.jpg" },
  { "userId": 3, "lat": 40.779437, "lng": -73.963244, "ts": 1706636265000, "avatarUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar7.jpg" }
]
```

> 💡 Users who have an active session but haven't sent any location update yet are **excluded** from the snapshot (their `location` is `null`).

> 💡 Users who are disconnected (within the 48h reconnect window but not currently connected) are **excluded** from the snapshot.

### 2. `location:update`

Received when **another user** in the room sends a location update. You will **not** receive your own updates.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("location:update", (data) => {
  // Update user's position on the map
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface LocationUpdate {
  userId: number;   // The user who sent this update
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
  ts: number;       // Unix timestamp (milliseconds), set by the server
  avatarUrl: string;  // User's avatar URL (from Redis cache)
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{ "userId": 5, "lat": 40.785091, "lng": -73.968285, "ts": 1706636270000, "avatarUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar5.jpg" }
```

---

### 3. `user:offline`

Received **immediately** when a user's **last socket disconnects** or when a user **ends their session**. The frontend should remove the user's marker from the map right away. **Not sent** for users in ghost/private mode.

> ⚠️ **Changed behavior:** Previously, `user:offline` was only sent after the reconnect grace period expired. Now it is sent **immediately** on disconnect so the frontend does not show stale locations.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("user:offline", (data) => {
  // Remove user marker from the map immediately
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface UserOffline {
  userId: number;
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{ "userId": 5 }
```

---

### 4. `user:online`

Received when a user **reconnects** after being offline (their session was in the disconnected/grace period state and they re-attached a socket). The frontend should re-add the user's marker on the map. **Not sent** for users in ghost/private mode.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("user:online", (data) => {
  // Re-add user marker on the map
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface UserOnline {
  userId: number;
  lat: number;
  lng: number;
  ts: number;      // Unix timestamp (milliseconds)
  avatarUrl: string;  // User's avatar URL (from Redis cache)
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{ "userId": 5, "lat": 40.785091, "lng": -73.968285, "ts": 1706636290000, "avatarUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar5.jpg" }
```

---

### 5. `session:resumed`

Received after a **successful** `reconnect-session` request. Contains the restored session state.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("session:resumed", (data) => {
  // Session is restored — resume location tracking
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface SessionResumed {
  roomId: string;
  sessionId: number;
  location: {           // Last known location (null if no location was sent yet)
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    ts: number;
  } | null;
  disconnectedAt: number | null;  // Unix timestamp (ms) when disconnect happened
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "roomId": "central-park-runners",
  "sessionId": 12345,
  "location": { "lat": 40.785091, "lng": -73.968285, "ts": 1706636270000 },
  "disconnectedAt": 1706636290000
}
```

---

### 6. `session:resume-failed`

Received when a `reconnect-session` request **fails**.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("session:resume-failed", (data) => {
  // Handle failure — start a new session instead
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface SessionResumeFailed {
  reason: "room-missing" | "not-active" | "session-mismatch";
}
```

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `room-missing` | No `roomId` was provided in the reconnect request |
| `not-active` | No active session exists for this user in the given room (expired or ended) |
| `session-mismatch` | The provided `sessionId` doesn't match the server's active session ID |

**Example Response:**

```json
{ "reason": "not-active" }
```

---

### 7. `user:hype`

Received when a user sends a "hype" (highfive) to someone in the room. This is broadcast to the room so the frontend can display an animation or message.

**Listen:**

```typescript
socket.on("user:hype", (data) => {
  // Check if the current user is the target, or just show an animation between sender and target
});
```

**Payload:**

```typescript
interface UserHype {
  senderId: number;     // The user who sent the hype
  targetUserId: number; // The user who received the hype
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{ "senderId": 2, "targetUserId": 5 }
```

## 🗄️ Redis Data Model

All location data is persisted in Redis with a **48-hour TTL**.

| Key Pattern | Type | TTL | Description |
|-------------|------|-----|-------------|
| `session:{sessionId}:path` | List (`RPUSH`) | 48 hours | Ordered list of **all** location points for a session. Each entry is a JSON string: `{"lat":..., "lng":..., "ts":..., "minute":...}` (the `minute` field is present only if the frontend sends it). Points are **buffered in memory** and flushed to Redis every 10 seconds. |
| `user:{userId}:avatar` | String (`SET`) | 48 hours | The user's avatar URL. **Written by the HTTP backend** when a session is created. Read by the WS server once at `start-session` and cached in memory. Explicitly deleted on `discard-session`. |

> 💡 The `session:{sessionId}:user:{userId}:last-location` key has been **removed**. The last known location is now tracked only in memory (`userData.location`). The backend only needs `session:{id}:path` (via `LRANGE`) at session end.

### Example Redis Entries

```
# Path points (list — flushed from memory buffer every 10 seconds)
session:12345:path → [
  '{"lat":40.785091,"lng":-73.968285,"ts":1706636270000,"minute":1}',
  '{"lat":40.785120,"lng":-73.968300,"ts":1706636272000,"minute":1}',
  '{"lat":40.785200,"lng":-73.968400,"ts":1706636332000,"minute":2}',
  ...
]

# User avatar (string — written by HTTP backend at session creation)
user:42:avatar → 'https://res.cloudinary.com/xxx/avatars/avatar3.jpg'
```

---

## 🧠 In-Memory Data Structures

The server maintains two primary Maps for real-time state:

### `activeUsersByRoom`

```
Map<roomId, Map<userId, ActiveUserSession>>
```

```typescript
type SessionMode = 'normal' | 'ghost' | 'private';

interface ActiveUserSession {
  sessionId: number;                              // Session ID from backend
  sockets: Set<string>;                           // All connected socket IDs for this user
  location: { lat, lng, ts, minute? } | null;     // Last known location (in-memory only)
  reconnectTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null;  // Cleanup timer after disconnect
  disconnectedAt: number | null;                  // Timestamp of last disconnect
  paused: boolean;                                // Whether the session is paused
  sessionMode: SessionMode;                       // 'normal', 'ghost', or 'private'
  avatarUrl: string;                              // User's avatar URL (read from Redis at session start)
  pathBuffer: Location[];                         // Buffered location points (flushed to Redis every 10s)
  flushTimer: ReturnType<typeof setInterval> | null;  // Periodic flush timer
}
```

### `activeBySocket`

```
Map<socketId, { roomId, userId, sessionId, sessionMode }>
```

Quick lookup from a socket ID to its room/user/session context.

## 🔄 Session Reconnection Flow

When a user disconnects (network drop, app backgrounded, etc.), the server does **not** immediately remove them. Instead:

```
┌──────────────┐
│   DISCONNECT │    Socket disconnects
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────┐

       │
       ├──── User reconnects within window ────▶ ✅ session:resumed
       │     (via reconnect-session event)         Timer cancelled
       │                                           Socket re-attached
       │
       └──── Timer expires ────▶ ❌ finalizeSession()
                                    user:offline broadcast
                                    Session removed from memory
```

> 💡 **Multi-device support:** A single user can have multiple sockets attached to the same session. The session only enters the reconnect grace period when **all** sockets are disconnected.

  // 2. Join a room to see other runners
  vici.joinRoom("morning-runners");

  // 3. When user taps "Start Run"
  // Normal mode (default)
  vici.startSession("morning-runners", 12345);

  // Or ghost/private mode — location is NOT shared with the room
  // vici.startSession("morning-runners", 12345, "ghost");   // Still captures territory
  // vici.startSession("morning-runners", 12345, "private"); // Skips territory capture

  // 4. During the run — send GPS location periodically
  vici.sendLocation(40.785091, -73.968285);

  // 5. If socket disconnects and reconnects
  vici.reconnectSession();

  // 6. When user taps "End Run"
  vici.endSession();

  // 7. Access the run path for analytics
  const runPath = vici.getLocalPath();

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Order Matters** — Always `join-room` before `start-session`. Use `leave-room` to cleanly exit a room without disconnecting the socket.
2. **Local Path Storage** — Store your own location updates locally for path rendering. The server stores them in Redis but doesn't send them back to you.
3. **Reconnect Grace Period** — After disconnect, the session stays alive for **48 hours** (configurable via `SESSION_RESUME_WINDOW_MS`). Use `reconnect-session` within this window.
4. **Session ID** — Must be obtained from your Express/REST backend before starting a session.
5. **Multi-Device Support** — The same user can connect from multiple devices/sockets. All sockets are tracked per user per room.
6. **Immediate Offline** — When all of a user's sockets disconnect, `user:offline` is broadcast **immediately** (not after grace period). The session data stays alive for the reconnect window, but other users see them as offline right away.
7. **Online on Reconnect** — When a disconnected user reconnects within the grace period, `user:online` is broadcast with their last known location.
8. **Silent Validation** — `join-room`, `start-session`, `location:update`, and `end-session` **silently ignore** malformed payloads. Only `reconnect-session` sends error responses.
9. **Server-Side Timestamps** — The `ts` field in `location:update` broadcasts is set by the server via `Date.now()`, not by the client.
10. **Redis TLS** — If your `REDIS_URL` starts with `rediss://`, TLS is automatically enabled with `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
11. **Redis Retry** — The server retries Redis connections up to 10 times with exponential backoff (100ms → 3000ms), and auto-reconnects on `READONLY`, `ECONNRESET`, and `ETIMEDOUT` errors.
12. **Session Modes** — `start-session` accepts an optional `sessionMode`: `"ghost"` or `"private"`. Both suppress **all** room broadcasts (`location:update`, `user:online`, `user:offline`) and exclude the user from `location:snapshot`. Data saving to Redis is **unchanged**. Note that the backend completes Ghost sessions with full territory capture, while Private sessions skip territory capture.
13. **No Self-Events** — `user:online` and `user:offline` events from pause/resume/reconnect are sent only to **other** users in the room (via `socket.to()`), not to the user themselves.
14. **Buffered Path Writes** — Location points are **not** written to Redis on every update. They are buffered in memory and flushed every 10 seconds (configurable via `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`). The buffer is flushed on `end-session`, `disconnect`, and session finalization. On `discard-session`, the buffer is **cleared without flushing**.
15. **Consecutive Deduplication** — If a user sends a `location:update` with the same `lat`/`lng` as their last known position, it is silently skipped. This keeps path and area data clean by eliminating stationary noise.
16. **No `last-location` Key** — The `session:{id}:user:{id}:last-location` Redis key has been removed. Last known location is tracked only in memory.
17. **Active-Minute Counter** — The optional `minute` field in `location:update` enables per-minute speed analysis. The frontend should maintain a simple counter that starts at `1`, increments every 60 seconds of active running, and **freezes** during pauses. The backend groups path points by this counter and computes average speed per minute. Gaps in the minute sequence naturally indicate paused/disconnected periods.
